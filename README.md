This program can encrypt and decrypt an input string based off user input. 
When run the user will be queried to decide between encrypting and decrypting. Once the user picks an option the program will then ask for some additional inputs. (words geting encrypted or decrypted, and a key)
After this the program will display the encrypted/decrypted result derived from the inputs. 

To run this program open it in visual studio and run it through the editor. This is a default VS project so the dependencies should be default. There are no packages used. 

Limitations
This tool is for educational purposes only and should never be used for sensitive information/data. This program utilizes a caesar cyper for encryption/decryption so all failures/warnings that come with such a cypher
applies here. Do not use this tool to seriously protect encrypted data, Caesar ciphers can be broken. This prgram is very simple and does not include functionality past encrypting/decrypting an input. Also, this program
requires a key, if the key is forgotten decryption will not be possible with this program.      

Responsible Usage
When utilizing this tool realize that it is a simple program. This tool should not be capable of causing damage or harm to anyone inheritily due to its simplicity. The only shortfall would be if someone utlized this
to protect sensite data, as Caesar ciphers can be broken. See prior warning above. Modifying this code for mallicous purposed would be difficult as this program has extremly limited functionality. Do not utilize 
this program to decrypt sensitive data using a Caesar cipher.
